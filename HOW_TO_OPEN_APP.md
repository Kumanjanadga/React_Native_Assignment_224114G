## ❌ Still Not Working?

### Problem: Browser doesn't open when pressing `w`
**Solution**: 
- Make sure the terminal window is selected (click on it)
- Try typing `w` again
- Or manually open: `http://localhost:19006`

### Problem: Browser opens but shows blank page
**Solution**: 
- Wait 20-30 seconds (it's still compiling)
- Refresh the page (press F5)
- Check terminal for any error messages

### Problem: "Cannot connect" error
**Solution**: 
- Make sure `npm start` is still running
- Don't close the terminal
- Try refreshing the browser

### Problem: Port 19006 not working
**Solution**: 
- Check the terminal - it might show a different port
- Look for a URL like `http://localhost:XXXXX`
- Use that URL instead
